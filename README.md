# Grocery-Management-System
 A simple GMS using the fundamental concepts of programming fundamentals

You have to develop a system for a Grocery Store let us call it Grocery Store Management System. 
Your system should be able to store data related to the grocery items. The details of the items must be 
maintained to develop a repository. The system should be able to generate bills for the customers and 
update the repository whenever there is a sale transaction. Furthermore, the system should be able to 
prompt if a certain item runs out so that the manager may decide for timely reinforcements.

1) Start by reading the data (i.e grocery items) from a file which would contain the details as shown 
below. Set a limit to the number of items to be stored in the store (say 50). Every item may or 
may not have a fixed number of quantity available (say 50 boxes/bottles/packs). Once you 
upload the data, you can now work on the successive parts respectively.
The information related to the item(s) is as follows:
-> Product ID
-> Product Name
-> Weight
-> Price (per pack/per bottle)
-> Quantity

2) Now that you have the data available with you, you must do the following:
-> Insert new item
-> Delete an item
-> Update quantity (increase or decrease)
-> Update price
-> Search the price of an item
-> Search the remaining quantity of an item
Remember these functionalities will be used time and again so you need to use appropriate 
programming practices. Furthermore, system should prompt the user once an item runs out of 
quantity.

3) Now that the system is ready for the sale transactions. The system should be able to display bills 
for the purchased quantities inculcating tax amount and discounts (if any). The same receipt 
should be output to a file so that the customer may get a print-out.
